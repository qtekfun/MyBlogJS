This is the first post of networks category in the web. As this is one of my most interesting topics but I don't
have enough knowledge about it, I will write down each thing I learn about it. Let's start with ARP.

## What is ARP?

ARP is the acronym of **Address Resolution Protocol**. It is a comunication protocol used for discovering physical
addresses (MAC addresses) of the resources within a network.

## Where ARP is used?

It operates in the layer 2 of the OSI model, the Data Link Layer.

## How ARP works?

It's a request-response protocol. It's only used withing a subnetwork and it's never routed.

## ARP package structure

You can have a look [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol) for the package structure and
more info.

That's all for today. Keep learning.
